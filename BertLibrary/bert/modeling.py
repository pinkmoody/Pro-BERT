    Args:
      vocab_size: Vocabulary size of `inputs_ids` in `BertModel`.
      hidden_size: Size of the encoder layers and the pooler layer.
      num_hidden_layers: Number of hidden layers in the Transformer encoder.
      num_attention_heads: Number of attention heads for each attention layer in
        the Transformer encoder.
      intermediate_size: The size of the "intermediate" (i.e., feed-forward)
        layer in the Transformer encoder.
      hidden_act: The non-linear activation function (function or string) in the
        encoder and pooler.
      hidden_dropout_prob: The dropout probability for all fully connected
        layers in the embeddings, encoder, and pooler.
      attention_probs_dropout_prob: The dropout ratio for the attention
        probabilities.
      max_position_embeddings: The maximum sequence length that this model might
        ever be used with. Typically set this to something large just in case
        (e.g., 512 or 1024 or 2048).
      type_vocab_size: Th
